The Student Enrollment System is a web-based application developed using PHP that simplifies and streamlines the process of enrolling students into courses. This system provides an efficient way for both students and administrators to manage course enrollments, ensuring a smooth and organized enrollment process.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The system includes secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms. Different user roles such as administrators and students have distinct access levels and permissions.

- **Course Management:** Administrators can add, edit, and delete courses from the system. Each course contains details such as course code, title, description, and available slots.

- **Student Enrollment:** Students can view a list of available courses and enroll in their desired courses within the specified enrollment period.

- **Enrollment Validation:** The system prevents over-enrollment by tracking the available slots for each course and limiting the number of students who can enroll.

- **Dashboard:** Both students and administrators have personalized dashboards displaying their enrolled courses, course schedule, and other relevant information.

- **Notifications:** Automated notifications are sent to students confirming their successful enrollment. Additional notifications can be implemented for various events such as enrollment period opening and closing.

- **Search and Filters:** The system provides search and filtering options for courses, making it easy for students to find and enroll in courses of interest.
